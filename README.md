For A4Q1 we weere tasked to use a loop to build a symmetric shape, I chose a star. The
loop had to be packaged inside a custom fcuntion so that you can pass parameter that set atleast 
one aspect of the star like scale, color, number of points (if you were using a flower it'd be 
easier to use points ). Then once the function was created you had to make multiple of that shape 
you chose.

For A4Q2 we yet again had to create a loop to make rowws and colums of an object in p5.js, I chose 
to do stars again. you also had to add a aspect to see a difference in the colums so I made 
every other star bigger / smaller, all the stars were red in a 450 x 450 canvas.

For A4Q3 we were allowed to use the same code as in question 2 so I did, but this time we had to add a random aspect in the code that chnaged everytime we
actually ran the code. I chose to make it so that everytime I ran the code all of the colors of the stars would chnage random between red, orange, yellow,
green, blue, and purple. kept it simple with the colors so I didnt have different shades of red or blue which could have looked like they were the same
color if they were side by side.

For A4Q4 We could choose to use the same code but we had to incorporate an array within the code. For my array I chose to make a rainbow type array, where
across the canvas the colors change. Out of all of my questions for assignemtn 4 my most proud of and coolest in my opinion is my last one. all of my stars
are in there rows/colums evenly and with the array for the rainbow it looks smooth.
